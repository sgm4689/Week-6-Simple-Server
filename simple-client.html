<!--
For testing purposes, here we are creating a client app that is completely independent of 
our web server that is running on Heroku. This app can be double clicked and run off 
of the desktop.

DO NOT do this for Project 1!

Instead, create client.html in the client folder as we did in the HW assignments, and have
node "serve it up", along with any other CSS or JS files.

This also guarantees that your client and server are both "awake" on Heroku at the same time.
